**Data Science Project: Impact of Psychosocial Factors on Medical Treatment Outcomes**
This project investigates how psychosocial factors—such as race, income, education level, and psychiatric disturbances—affect the survival rates and treatment outcomes for patients undergoing medical procedures like transplantation.

**Problem Statement**
We explored the relationship between social and psychological factors and health outcomes, focusing on:

**The impact of race, education status, and income on survival rates.#**
The effect of psychiatric disturbances and relapse history on treatment-related morbidity and disease-free survival rates.

**Key Findings**

Locations with higher income levels ($40,000+) had significantly better survival rates, regardless of education level.
Patients with psychiatric disturbances had shorter survival intervals post-transplant compared to those without such conditions.
Lower transplant-to-survival intervals were strongly associated with increased mortality, especially when paired with relapse.

**Technologies Used**
Python
Pandas for data manipulation
